										<h3>What is Quadrix?</h3>
										<p>Quadrix is a single player puzzle game.  The objective of the game is to clear rows of blocks to rack up points and achieve the highest score possible.  Tetrominoes spawn in the center of the gameboard and are dropped into one of the four quadrants. The player attempts to arrange the tetrominoes into complete lines and when they do so those lines will disappear and points will be added to the playerâ€™s total score.  The game is over when the tetrominoes on the board pile up to the center of the board preventing a new tetromino from spawning.</p>
										<hr />
										<h3>What do I control?</h3>
										<p>The player controls the movement of tetrominoes as they are dropped into a single quadrant of the gameboard.  The player may rotate the tetromino, swap the tetromino with the next tetromino in the queue, and move the tetromino left, right, and downward in respect to the quadrant the piece is falling in. Once the tetromino can no longer be forced further in its primary direction the tetromino comes to rest at that point and a new tetromino spawns in the center of the board. The next (2) spawns are visible to the player and he/she may switch the order that these pieces will spawn.</p>
										<h3></h3>
										<p>Quadrix is similar to a classic game that many players know and love (i.e. the original Tetris). What distinguishes Quadrix is that it has taken this concept and multiplied it by four, adding a new dimension that will keep players guessing and heighten the experience.</p>

											<h3>Why create Quadrix?</h3>
											<p>We created this game because we wanted gamers to experience a new take on a classic game design.  Our goal is to enhance the experience of a game that many video game fans would find familiar.</p>

											<h3>What is the main focus?</h3>
											<p>The main focus is to arrange the tetrominoes such that lines continue to be formed thereby maintaining adequate space for future spawns.  By doing so the player is able to continue play as long as possible and their score will continue to rise to new heights as they go.</p>
